# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: 

I am a fish biologist at the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute in Iceland. My primary interest is the biology and ecology of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), with other interests including the biology of mesopelagic fishes and the distribution and behaviour of rare species. Lumpfish is fished commercially in Iceland and I am responsible for providing management advice to ensure the fishery is sustainable. My current work focuses on the development of a method for ageing of lumpfish, examining its migratory behaviour through tagging and what environmental variables drive its distribution in the eastern Atlanatic.

I have previously worked on the reproductive biology of several species (plaice, herring, cod and Greenland halibut) which was performed at the marine laboratory on the Isle of Man and at the University of Bergen.
